Piker
=====
Monolithic Kernel for the Raspberry Pi

This is a kernel I've been working on in some of my spare time for fun.
My hope is to create a basic operating system that can execute multiple processes simultaneously in virtual memory, with disk io, graphical output and hopefully USB mouse&keyboard input.

Think of an extremely minimal unix-like system.

The name itself is just a portmanteu of "Pi" and "Kernel". I'm studying CompSci after all, not creative writing.
